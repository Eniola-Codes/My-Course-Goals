## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands in the terminal :


### `npm install`

It downloads all the Required dependencies for the code result to be run on development mode in local host

### `npm start`

Runs the app development mode on your browser.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it after running the command.

The page will be reloaded and changed as you make changes and your code is getting compled.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for deployment & production to a `build` folder.\
It optimizes the build for the best performance and correctly bundles React in production mode. 

The build is minified and the unnecessary files are removed.\
Your application is now ready to be deployed.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: Once you `eject`, you can't go back! It is a one way operation**

If the Configurtion choices and the build tools does not suit your needs, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

You don't have to use `eject`. The already made features is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel like using this feature is necessary. However we understand, so it's important that you are able to customize this feature when you have full knowledge of how it works which makes it more useful to you.
