# Description

A Course goal application which you can use to store information of a user

The application takes on an input from the user in a form which is the Course Goal :

![Form](https://github.com/Eniola-Codes/User-Data-App/blob/main/src/assets/userform.png?raw=true)

The form comes with a validation, if you input an invalid value, you will get an error style.

On the other hand, when you submit a valid value,an item is added to the bucket list

**Technologies**

Technologies i used to build this are React.js and css

I used React.js framework to bootstrap this project because of the below functionalities : 

- Seperation of concerns (Having leaner files and components by breaking down the code into smaller parts)
- Prop drilling to pass some data from component to component with ease.
- Css modules which prevent clashing of classnames around components therefore avoiding unwanted results

# Installation and Running

git clone or pull the project using your terminal, open the project folder on your local laptop in a code editor and run "npm start" in your editors terminal.
